# Frameworkless PHP

In this application I'll be teaching you how PHP frameworks work by building one step by step.

I'll be doing this using **modern standards**, **best practices** and **third party packages** where necessary.

The resulting code can be used to write a PHP application without using a full third-party framework like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).

In order to follow along you need to already be familiar with basic PHP.

## Steps

The full tutorial for each step is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFbnPuoQkKseimWeA4UFo1BPFTeXnv_1S).

Each step builds upon the next, and links to each of the steps are below.
