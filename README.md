# Frameworkless PHP: Create a PHP Application Without a Framework

In this application I'll be teaching you how PHP frameworks work by building one step by step.

I'll be doing this using modern standards, best practices and third party packages where necessary.

The resulting code can be used to write a PHP application without using a full third-party framework like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).

In order to follow along you need to already be familiar with basic PHP.

## Steps

The tutorial for each step is on YouTube. Each step builds upon the next, and the links to each of the videos are below.
